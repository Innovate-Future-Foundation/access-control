├── README.md              # This file
├── _template.json         # Template for new user requests
├── _INSTRUCTIONS.md       # Detailed instructions
└── requests/             # Directory for user access requests
    └── .gitkeep         # Keeps the empty directory in git

- The `requests/` directory is where new team members should place their access request files
- The `.gitkeep` file is only used to maintain the empty directory in git
